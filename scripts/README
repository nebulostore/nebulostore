DEVELOPING GUIDELINES
    Please adhere to following rules and assumptions when writing scripts:
        1. Scripts know that they are placed in folder scripts in the main
            directory.
        2. Scripts know relative position of other files in scripts/ directory
        3. Scripts that are used by other scripts and are not be called from
            bash shell begin with an underscore.
        4. Main level scripts are agnostic of the directory they are being
            called from and should preserve it on exit.
