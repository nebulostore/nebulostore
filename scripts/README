Please run all scripts from trunk level (./scripts/script-name.sh).

Tests available:
    1. Local tests:
        ./scripts/run-local-test.sh

    2. Planet-lab tests (ssh key required):
        ./scripts/run-planet-lab-test.sh

    Note:
        For run-planet-lab-test.sh make sure that you have uploaded necessary
        libraries by running:
            scripts/upload-libs-to-planet.sh

        If you want to re-generate the list of working peers use
            bash scripts/select-sane-planet-lab-peers.sh > scripts/hosts.txt

    3. Interactive terminal
        ./scripts/console-test.sh


How to run Network ping-pong test (this should change soon):

1. Run communication/perform-test.sh DELAY where DELAY is the number of seconds
the test will be run.
2. Hosts on planetlab will now perform a pingpong test for at most DELAY number
of seconds.
3. Download 'testing.log' file from any of the hosts you used, (e.g. planetlab1.montefiore.ulg.ac.be):
      scp mimuw_nebulostore@planetlab1.montefiore.ulg.ac.be:~/grzesiek/testing.log .
4. Check if the file contains 'Found new peer' and 'Received msg' messages and no errors.
