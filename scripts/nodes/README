        from their website together with their metadata.

        bootable flag. Writes to output to bootable_nodes.txt

    hosts-all.txt - File based on bootable_nodes.txt in which we place all hosts
        that we might want to use (not necesarily working). Place

            prata.mimuw.edu.pl
        on top and perhaps shuffle it.
